AbilityHire by Elgen Prestosa

Pages:
* Homepage 
* About us
* Events
* JobSearch
* Profiling


Functions as of 6th of June 2023:
* The web application can do sign in and registration actions.
* For the registration, users can only have one account. Thus if they try to create another account, it will fail. Unique attributes are applied to firstname, lastname and email address.
* Navigate to other pages connected.


Missed Functions and Challenges (Future Refs):
* Load jobs from the Mongodb to the application. The application utilizes hard coded data for the job search page. 
* Add a resume builder.
* Have the Profiling page work by saving the data to the MongoDB.
* Incorporate dashboard page.
* Make the APPLY and VIEW DETAILS button work. If possible create another page/file for it.
* Add filters to the search function in the JobSearch.
